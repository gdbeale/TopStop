    <h3>Welcome to TopStop</h3>
    <hr/>
    <p><b>TopStop</b> is the place to find real-time MetroTransit bus and train departures from a hastily-assembled web application. It
        is built from the Flask python micro-framework -- which is a small, yet full featured web application
        technology. The backend is composed of a SQL-Lite DB, which runs in memory for performance reasons. The UI is
        laid out via Bootstrap 4 within Jinja templates.</p>
